                <h3>What is Valorant?</h3>

                <p>On paper, Valorant is a "hero oriented", team based, first-person shooter developed by Riot Games. In reality, it is a place of nightmare fuel, where people go to lose their souls and their wallets to cruel tech overlords. It quickly overtook the prominent shooters of the time in CS:GO, Overwatch, and if your're a psycopath, Call of Duty, making it the largest rage simulator on the market. Valorant is alright as a game, but it is known how it is because of the playerbase, many of whitch migrated from League of Legends, Riot Games's other horror show. These people hate themselves, the universe, but particuallraly you, thay make the game far worse than it should be and are an affront to society. Overall, Valorant is 5/10 stars, would not reccomend. - Average "Elohell" Player (Me).</p>

                    <p id="imaddicted">While Valorant is terrible and shouldn't be played by anyone, I continue to engage in the mentally taxing process that is losing all of my RR in one sitting. I do this because I have a crippling addiction to Valorant and I require it to properly function. If there is one thing that Riot Games is good at, it is certanly not game design, but claiming more and more victims by the day.</p>
