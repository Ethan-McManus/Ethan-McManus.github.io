            <h3>Avergae Terrible Player</h3>
            <p>"Alright this might be really long so sorry.(I'm new to fps shooters and CS-GO type games) Alright today in comp match (im iron 2) we were winning 10-2 at the switch and then we proceeded to lose like almost 11 times in a row and we lost, keep in mind this happens a lotttt in my games. And at the start I'm top fragging and leading by like 5-8 kills but for the rest of the game I only get like 0-3 kills and I end up falling behind by like 10-15 kills and second to bottom fragging and this happens in almost every match I play. Also I feel like I have the raw mechanics of like a silver or gold, my highscore in gridshot in aimlab is 63000. And I get lucky headshotted every round to kids with bad aim and I feel like if my whole team Is gun fighting someone and I'm in the back running around they literally shoot me instead of shooting MY TEAMMATES RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM so I die early almost every round after the switch for some reason before the 5th or so round or the early rounds I do really good but not the late rounds. And I feel like I get punished for my mistakes wayyy more than my teammates, like if I forget to shift walk, right as I turn the corner like three enemies are there expecting me, crosshair exactly at my head and I instantly die, buuttt when my teammates forget to shift walk they still surprise the enemies and end up wiping like 4 enemies.
